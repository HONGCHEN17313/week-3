## First Table Year 1990

```{r}

gss1990 <- gss_get_yr(1990)
select(gss1990, divorce, happy)

a <- gss1990 |>
  select(divorce, happy) |>
  drop_na() |>
  mutate(vdivorce = if_else(divorce == 1,
                             "Divorced",
                             "Not divorced"),
         vhappy = if_else (happy == 1 | happy == 2, #where happy=3 means not too happy
                           "Happy",
                           "Not happy")) |>

## 1990 Compute and Interpret

Marginal probability:

Being happy is 0.932, which means in total, 93.2% people are being happy.

```{r}
(173+655)/(173+655+18+42)
```

Being divorced is 0.215, which means in total, 21.5% people are divorced.

```{r}
(173+18)/(172+655+18+42)
```

Joint probability:

Being divorced and being happy is 0.195, which means among all people, 19.5% people are happy and divorced.

```{r}
173/(173+655+18+42)
```

Being unhappy and being not divorced is 0.047, which means among all people, 4.7% people are unhappy and not divorced.

```{r}
42/(173+655+18+42)
```

Conditional probabilityï¼š

Being happy in the condition of being divorced is 0.906, which means among divorced people, 90.6% are happy.

```{r}
173/(173+18)
```

Being divorced in the condition of being happy is 0.209 , which means among divorced people, 20.9% are happy.

```{r}
173/(173+655)
```

## Second Table Year 2022

```{r}
gss2022 <- gss_get_yr(2022)
b <- gss2022 |>
  select(divorce, happy) |>

         vhappy = if_else (happy == 1 | happy == 2,
                           "Happy",

```

## 2022 Compute and Interpret

Marginal probability:

Being happy is 0.846, which means in total, 84.6% people are happy.

```{r}
(424+1257)/(424+1257+101+204)
```

Being divorced is 0.264, which means in total, 26.4% people are divorced.

```{r}
(424+101)/(424+1257+101+204)

```

Joint probability:

Being divorced and being happy is 0.213, which means among all people, 21.3% are divorced and happy.

```{r}
424/(424+1257+101+204)
```

Being not divorced and being not happy is 0.103, which means among all people, 10.3% are divorced and not happy.

```{r}
204/(424+1257+101+204)
```

Conditional probability:

Being happy in the condition of being divorced is 0.808, which means among people who are divorced, 80.8% people are happy.

```{r}
424/(424+101)
```

Being divorced in the condition of being happy is 0.252, which means among people who are happy, 25.2% people are divorced.
